What is Middleware?
Middleware in Django is a way to process requests globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Middleware is a lightweight, low-level plugin system for globally altering Djangoâ€™s input or output.

How Middleware Works
Request Phase: When a request comes in, it goes through the middleware stack in the order defined in your settings.py file. Each middleware can alter the request or halt it before reaching the view.
Response Phase: After the view processes the request and returns a response, it goes back through the middleware stack in reverse order. Each middleware can alter the response or halt it before it reaches the client.
Common Uses of Middleware
Authentication: Ensuring user credentials are valid.
Session Management: Managing user sessions.
Caching: Storing parts of the response to speed up subsequent requests.
CSRF Protection: Protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
Logging: Logging requests and responses for monitoring.
Creating Custom Middleware
To create custom middleware, define a class with at least one of the following methods:

__init__(self, get_response): Called once when the web server starts.
__call__(self, request): Called on each request.
